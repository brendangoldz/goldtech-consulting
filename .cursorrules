# Cursor rules for GoldTech Consulting website

## General
- Favor modern JavaScript and React best practices.
- Use functional components and React hooks.
- Keep components small, modular, and self-documenting.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for styling; avoid inline styles unless dynamic.
- Handle asynchronous code with `async/await` and proper error handling.
- Validate props with PropTypes when TypeScript is not used.

## Testing
- Add or update tests using Jest and React Testing Library for all new functionality.
- Run `npm test -- --watchAll=false` before committing.

## Formatting
- Format code with Prettier (2-space indentation, no trailing whitespace).
- Ensure imports are ordered and unused code is removed.

## Git
- Use clear, imperative commit messages and keep commits focused.
- Do not commit generated files or build artifacts.

## Build
- When modifying Tailwind styles, run `npm run build:tailwind` to regenerate CSS.
- Ensure `npm run build` completes without errors before deployment.
