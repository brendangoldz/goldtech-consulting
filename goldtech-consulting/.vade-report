# Vercel Speed Insights Implementation

Successfully installed and configured Vercel Speed Insights for React in the GoldTech Consulting project.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Package
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` version 1.3.1 to the project dependencies
- Used npm (the project's package manager) to install the package

### 2. Modified Files

#### `package.json`
- Added `@vercel/speed-insights` to dependencies

#### `package-lock.json`
- Updated with the new package and its dependencies

#### `src/App.js`
- Added import statement: `import { SpeedInsights } from '@vercel/speed-insights/react';`
- Added `<SpeedInsights />` component inside the main App component's JSX, placed right after the existing `<Analytics />` component
- Positioned within the `<ContentProvider>` wrapper to ensure proper integration with the app's context

## Implementation Details

The SpeedInsights component was placed at the same level as the existing Vercel Analytics component, following the established pattern in the codebase. Both monitoring tools are now active:
- `<Analytics />` - tracks page views and user interactions
- `<SpeedInsights />` - measures real-user performance metrics (Core Web Vitals)

This placement ensures that Speed Insights will track performance across all routes in the application, including:
- Landing page
- Consulting and Marketing sections
- Service pages (both static and Sanity-based)
- Blog pages
- Confirmation and 404 pages

## Verification

✅ Build completed successfully - no errors introduced
✅ Linter check passed - no new linting errors in App.js
✅ Package installation completed with all dependencies resolved
✅ Lock file updated properly

The implementation follows React best practices and maintains consistency with the existing code structure. The Speed Insights component will automatically start collecting performance metrics when the application is deployed to Vercel.
