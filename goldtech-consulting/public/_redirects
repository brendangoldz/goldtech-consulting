# AWS Amplify redirects for React Router SPA
# 
# CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED: 
# You MUST remove the Console rewrite rule: /<*> → /index.html
# Console rewrites are processed BEFORE file existence checks, causing static assets
# to be rewritten to index.html (resulting in text/html MIME type errors)
#
# This _redirects file will handle SPA routing correctly - Amplify automatically
# serves existing files (like /static/js/*.js) with correct MIME types, and only
# rewrites non-existent paths to index.html for client-side routing

# Explicitly serve sitemap/robots without SPA rewrite
/sitemap.xml /sitemap.xml 200
/robots.txt /robots.txt 200

# SPA routing - catch-all for routes that don't match existing files
# This ensures /marketing, /consulting, etc. all work correctly
# Static assets in /static/ will be served automatically with correct MIME types
/* /index.html 200
