# AWS Amplify redirects for React Router SPA
# 
# IMPORTANT: If you removed the Console rewrite rule /<*> → /index.html,
# this file MUST be present in the build output for SPA routing to work.
#
# This file handles SPA routing - Amplify automatically serves existing files
# (like /static/js/*.js) with correct MIME types, and only rewrites non-existent
# paths to index.html for client-side routing

# Explicit routes for main pages (optional but can help with SEO)
/consulting /index.html 200
/marketing /index.html 200

# SPA routing - catch-all for all other routes that don't match existing files
# This ensures /marketing, /consulting, and any other routes all work correctly
# Static assets in /static/ will be served automatically with correct MIME types
/* /index.html 200
